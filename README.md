# stock-analysis
VBA project

# challenge

In the refactored code I organized it differntly to make the analysis more efficient. First we create all the variables and arrays that are ging to be used witout activating any of the worsheets. The next step is to activate the worksheets containing the dat anad using indexes to look for the volumes, starting and ending price. Finally we format the analysis worksheet and include all the results. 
I hace both codes included in the worksheet; so you can see the difference between the original and refactores allanalysis() VBA code.
